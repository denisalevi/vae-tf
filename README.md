TensorFlow Variational Autoencoder (VAE) implementation with methods for classification in latent space.

For an introduction to VAEs check out the blogpost series from [Fast Forward Labs](http://www.fastforwardlabs.com):

* [Part II: Under the Hood of the Variational Autoencoder (in Prose and Code)](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2016/08/22/under-the-hood-of-the-variational-autoencoder-in.html)
